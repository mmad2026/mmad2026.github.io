<h1>Travel grants</h1>

To support the participation of international (outside Denmark) early-stage researchers (including postdocs), our workshop is pleased to offer a limited number of travel grants. Applicants are required to submit the following materials:

<ul>
<li>Poster Abstract: A title and short abstract for a poster that you will present at the workshop.</li>
<li>CV: A brief curriculum vitae (max. 2 pages).</li>
<li>Supervisor's Letter of Support: A short confirmation from your supervisor supporting your application and your attendance at the workshop.</li>
</ul>

Send a single ZIP file containing those three documents (PDFs) to Miguel (jmvma AT dtu DOT dk). **In addition**, you must indicate in the <a href="registration">registration form</a> that you are applying for the travel grant.

Selection will be based on the relevance, as well as the applicant's overall profile.

<b>There will be no workshop proceedings and no peer-review. Presenters may choose to present work in progress or posters presented at other conferences.</b>
