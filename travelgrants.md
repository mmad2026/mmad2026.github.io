<h1>Travel grants</h1>

To support the participation of international (outside Denmark) early-stage researchers (including postdocs), our workshop is pleased to offer a limited number of travel grants. Applicants are required to submit the following materials:

<ul>
<li>Poster Abstract: A title and short abstract for a poster that you will present at the workshop.</li>
<li>CV: A brief curriculum vitae (max. 2 pages).</li>
<li>Supervisor's Letter of Support: A short confirmation from your supervisor supporting your application and your attendance at the workshop.</li>
</ul>

Selection will be based on the relevance, as well as the applicant's overall profile.

Details on how to submit the title, short abstract, CV and letter of support will be provided soon.
